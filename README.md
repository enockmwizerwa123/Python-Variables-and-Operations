# Python-Variables-and-Operations
In this section we are going to study about Variables and Operations in Python
In Python, a variable is a named location in memory that stores a value. You can think of a variable as a label for a value that you can later use or modify.
you can use the assignment operator `=` to assign a value to a variable. Once you have assigned a value to a variable, you can access and use the value by referring to the variable name.
Python supports several operations that you can perform on variables, including:

Arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, %, ** )
Comparison operations (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=)
Logical operations (and, or, not)
These operations can be used to perform various tasks, such as performing calculations, making decisions, and manipulating data.
